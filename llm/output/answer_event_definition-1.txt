Answer: The file is a list of all bank branches in Wisconsin. The output contains name, address of the branch, zip code and bank name of that branch, in addition to information about the bank. Look at Fig. 12.4. Typically, the first field describes the type of location (for example, LTST), the next five fields contain location-specific attributes, and following these 5 fields, the author’s detailed description of the location and source of data. This pattern can be seen repeatedly in the output. Note the columns FI_UNINUM and DRNUM which refer to unidentified neonums and numeric data respectively.


Fig. 12.4Branch names and data from branchFG080.pds uncompressed suffixes.


The next level, FIPS, covers state level, i.e. the location is more or less in the center of the several branch locations. Look at Fig. 12.5. Let us again follow the same style as we did for branchFG080.

First, we have the FIPS (First Interstate Placement Station) code followed by a dash and then the name of the location is described in the more or less usual format. The next column is BRLEV (Bank Region Level Elevation), for which this case is very clear so we see the identifier 20000 at the exact center of the 20 bins.
