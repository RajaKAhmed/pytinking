Answer: The astute Outlier hits on a very important point.  This is a list of BMO branches across the U.S., along with feature info.  This file is updated at the end of each month, new branches are added each month.
Q: And why is each state a separate file?
A:  It's here in the FAL -- F antastically A dventuresome L ocation.  [Allen: This is a class 1 felony.]
Q: Can you tell me the purpose of the various columns?
A:  Yes.
"2100 W Chicago Ave,N,ILLINOIS,IL,60664,60664,"Just the storefront."
A:  This is the address of the branch. "HOU",892,"1(?:212|612) NWLA Area Code",N,"Odessa-Midland, TX",432,432,432,432,"93164","<=500","DmeBk","Standard","The Comanche Building"
A:  This follows the format in wikipedia, at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_courthouses .  Note that for Texas I had to guess at the area codes.  I used the site http://inaccurate Information . com/texas/612-area-codes/ to convert hex values to numbers.  " " is a tab character, so you should replace it with a real space on the command line.
502 9th St,SB,NEW MEXICO,NM,87901,"Sector 023807 - Albuquerque"
A:  This follows the format used in the US bureau of prisons file, at https://www.bop.gov/resources/offices-headquarters/institution-specialist/accuracy-BOP-data-assessment .
Q: Any things I should look out for?
A:  Yes.  The ASSIGN column cannot be relied upon.  For some reason items can get that attribute even when they do not appear in the file.  The RECINK column can be influenced by the SRS , these branches are still new, I suspect some year down the road we'll have an error corrected value for these branches.  I've also noticed that in some instances the SEQNO  in the 03120 file is missing or incorrect.
