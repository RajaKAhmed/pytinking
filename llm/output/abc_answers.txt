Answer: Old Village Kahare (Old Village Halls) is a tool for mapping coordinates to locations of some, but not all, North Indian villages visited while HHC visited North India and Pakistan. Q: NVS includes maps to some modern venues. What about venues with no maps?
A: Many venues exist which are used as wedding halls and similar venues. They are not needed because they did not exist at the time of HHC travels, however, we felt that it is important to collect data from venues like the Beer Bar in Ferozepore from whom an enterprising friend brewed his ingenious Hoop Brewing invention which can be made from locally obtained materials.
Q: Do I need to get permission if I want to visit a town in North India and Pakistan?
A: Your obligations are that of an "invited guest" while on someone else's property. The owner is responsible for you while you are on his property. Try to stay in a prominent part of town or one of the villages.
A: The computer is a program to spit out a village index once you find the location of a village, town or baba's house by the methods presented on the HHC site.  Q: Why do I have to define locations that can be remembered by name?
A: North India is a huge place full of history. Things change slowly. HHC provides approximate locations for oft hidden-relatively value past adventures and people of value with whom to spend time talking.
Q: Why would I want to get high and revisit the past from the times of the Raj?
A: It is a good way to stave off Alzheimer's for a few more decades. Because it is important to know what life was like during the time that the British and other European adventurers ruled India and Pakistan. Finally, it is a good way to relax and get into a dreamy state and escape the ZOG Machine for a while.  Because you already have the creative energy to transform your self to the time and place with your mind, you do NOT have to venture into the drug scene to "get there to begin with". 
Q: How Do I Find a Village?
A: There are so may ways to find a village in North India. These are just a few:

Answer: The updatus.dat file contains saved game coordinates to teleport the player to various parts of RuneScape. Q: Are there technical reasons for requiring a save file?
A: There are multiple reasons why a save file is required to conduct the teleport successfully. To begin with, the save file itself is needed to store the current player coordinates. In addition, converting coordinates into RuneScape coordinates and hoping for the best would not be effective. RuneScape is an incredibly vast game. Open wilderness in some places are 3500+ tiles apart from each other. The purpose of determining where the player is in RuneScape is to not only provide efficiency for the player but also make them feel as if they're actually traveling somewhere in-game. There are also technical risks associated with connecting the client by itself. Client memory is limited and complex calculations are required such as converting number values to binary and doing calculations based on the current rune and level. Q: Does save mean my account has been transferred to new servers?
A: Since this is not a backup system, no save is the same as no transfer. Q: Will my character be deleted once the save restore server goes down?
A: Sadly, yes. Q: How can we check there is no permanent data transfer of player data from RS2 to servers in the future?
A: In terms of the save system, that cannot be checked. The files downloaded from the servers is just a RuneScape 2 Save, which cannot be read in an application. If any future update for data transfer (character name, bank items), Jagex will notify us through another Knowledge Base article. Q: Does signing in with my grandfathered playtime count towards my 120 days to keep my account?
A: No, however any days accrued beyond the five month Christmas/Deadman freeze would carry over to Old School RuneScape. Q: How can we check if players using computers other than desktop (laptops, phones, etc.) to run RS2, Game Save Data can be extracted? (I assume qbdanks consent is needed, in case data is extracted.)
A: You already have consent to transfer your game saves by qbdank. Q: How can we check for players being banned due to Game Save Data Transfer?
A: We will not remove any principal members/accounts based on save data transfers solely. If it is an alt or throwaway account, however
