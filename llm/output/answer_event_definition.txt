Answer: The content of each customer files will be described in the next part, but first we take a look at ERS and you will see soon enough what is in the file.

The simple definition would be a collection of records, so we call a file collection of records or rows. Although the file consists of records, we choose to display the information in tables. A table to display the delivery addresses looks like
245,450 N 56th,San Mateo,CA,California,94402,Linfox USA,3 Deliveries,08/22/2014 71105,70 N Admiral Plz,Chicago,IL,Illinois,60611,Kwik Copy,2 Deliveries,Incomplete 03/07/2015 00067,521 N Beach 116 Dr,Rhode Island,RI,50812,Rhode-Island Port Authority,1 Courier pickups,08/20/2014 83950,N Villa Ct,South Jordan,UT,84117,Rhode-Island Port Authority,1 Deliveries,03/06/2015 75001,Mo'a Kea Hotel,7777 Mauna Lani Dr #100,Kailua-Kona,HI,96867,Hawaiian Transportation Service,1 Deliveries,08/21/2014

One address is a receiving address for returned packages and the other address is where the packages are sent. The City ZIP values are the same, for example 64121, yet the periods are different.

The delivery address is a location a company does business. In our case, it is the location of Linfox. Notice above it is related to the entity Linfox. There is no mention of "delivery address" in the Sales Invoice table. It is not a Linfox record, it is a location where Linfox does business and an address of a customer.
The entity can be customer, supplier, employee, any other company, you get the picture. So now that you've got it, let's
