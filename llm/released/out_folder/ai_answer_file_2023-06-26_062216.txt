Answer: The file is an Excel file, where each row represents one bank branch and contains the branch address, city, state, county, zip code, service type and much more. Q: How does a bank branch tenant object look like?
A: The Bank_Tenant_Source_Appraisal_Report.xml.gz file looks like this (try it with your favorite compression program): word 2003 zip schema doc word 2008 zip schema doc xml ntext ntext ---------------------------------------------------- | word 2003 zip schema doc word 2008 zip schema doc xml ntext ntext | ---------------------------------------------------- x16000000000000000210000000000FFFE /* headers */ 
x200BC00000012030000200000002000000 /* footers */

Q: Can I use the number of customers as a performance benchmark?
A: In general you can not use the number of customers as a performance benchmark when building your decision support system. If you try to do so and the performance of your data discovery system sucks, then no optimization tweak will help you! There are however reasons to keep the number of customers if you want to:
- generate additional non-IT and IT KPIs;
- run additional separation tests;
- compare various scenarios;
- evaluate the potential of the CRM add-in tools;
- await for the next release of the CRM Connector.
Q: I want to avoid rebuilding the full data warehouse (DWH). Can I still experiment with data mining and predictive modeling features of the DWH using subsets of data?
A: Yes. The combination of csv files and R will help you in this case:
- build the ETL process for your favorite data mining algorithms;
- construct a SQL/PL script for data mining;
- have the ETL replicate the data stores used for data mining;
- make them immediately available for analysis.
If the ETL script is coded correctly, you can even make each update to the source CSVs available to business analysts, data miners

Answer: The file shows the account number, the bank name, the state, the county, the city, the branch address, and the zip code.

Q: How can I use the file?
A: You can use the file to make some interesting plots.

For example, you can use the county as the x-coordinate, the city as the y-coordinate, and the population as the value. You can use the population data to color the points. You can add a legend to the plot to show what each color represents. The following code gives the plot:

library(ggplot2) # For plotting

bank <- read.table("datasets/bank_account.txt",header=T) # Read the file

colnames(bank) <- c("state","county","city","address","zip") # Change the names to column names

bank$state <- bank$state[order(bank$state)] # Sort by state

bank$city <- bank$city[order(bank$city)] # Sort by city

bank$county <- bank$county[order(bank$county)] # Sort by county

bank$address <- bank$address[order(bank$address)] # Sort by address

bank$zip <- bank$zip[order(bank$zip)] # Sort by zip

bank$population <- bank$population[order(bank$population)] # Sort by population

bank$city <- as.factor(bank$city) # Turn cities into factors

bank$income <- bank$population / bank$zip # Turn population into income

bank$income <- bank$income * 10000 # Turn population into income in thousands

ggplot(bank,aes(x=county,y=city,color=income)) +

geom_text(aes(label=city),color="black") +
